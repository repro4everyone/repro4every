We arrived at a point in the history of science in which we have formally defined the so-called reproducibility crisis, known as the ongoing tendency to fail to reproduce or replicate results of previous published scientific results. 
In order to talk about reproducibility, I refer to the concept as a unified definition including the definition of replicability, as for the purpose of the debate, reproducibility and replicability are under the same umbrella in the crisis. 

Although we can trace the concept of a reproducibility crisis back in decades, [it was just around 2015 that this topic expanded](https://www.nature.com/articles/533452a) and arrived at the debates of science communication and publication policies. Nowadays, we can find a great deal of debate about this crisis itself or also within the context of broader topics such as Open Science and Open Access. 

The essence of reproducibility lies in the **value** that it represents. While many advocates have been deeply disseminating the practical measures that can be taken to fight the crisis of reproducibility, it is fundamental to remind us what it represents and the value that it brings. 

**Reproducibility** can be very well understood as a new possible mindset framing the way we do and value work. The current mindset that has led our way of working to **pursue progress** has been **productivity**. The value of productivity has not yet been overcome by any other value and it is our leading force to qualify the work of others and our own. 

During our journey to face the crisis of reproducibility, we find ourselves as workers, scientists and researchers diving in a deep sea of produced knowledge and as we dive in it, we drown in the impossibility to reproduce what was disseminated before aiming to build upon it. Thus, productivity has given us its promised outcome, which was rather a vast aggregate of knowledge. It did not, however, promise that all the outcome pieces would be necessarily **connected**.

Here is when reproducibility brings a new value into our working and research culture that producitivity was not able to give us. **While productivity will always provide us with growth, reproducibility is here to provide us with connection**. The value of reproducibility is to equipe our working culture with a new dimension that was not fully considered until recently, in which we want to grow but we are in need of a meaningful instead of a disconnected growth. 

The trade-off that comes necessary when coupling productivity with reproducibility is undeniable but fundamentally beneficial. As we continue to grow, our knowledge becomes more complex and with its complexity, its connectivity starts being at risk. 
Disseminating our work enabling the possibility for others to reproduce our research, not only makes us transparent, but we also open the way for others to build on top of our previous results. In science, we value transparency over correctness and we need to start valuing connection at least as much as we value growth.
